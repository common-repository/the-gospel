Easily integrate the Christian Gospel message on your WordPress website using the shortcode [gospel] on any post or page.

== Description ==

You can now easily display the Christian Gospel message on your WordPress website with The Gospel plugin by <a href="http://www.rocapress.com">RocaPress</a>.

Our hope is that thousands of Christian will take advantage of this plugin and use it to promote the biblical Gospel. Not everyone writes well. So we thought it would be useful to make this plugin available with a well written and theologically sound Gospel message for the average Christian.

It is simple to use. Just insert the shortcode [gospel] on any page or post.

At the end of the Gospel message you will find the words "Seek and join a Bible-believing and teaching church."  This makes a direct link to the 9Marks.org website, where your visitors can find sound churches.

Thanks to <a href="http://justinpeters.org" target="_blank">Justin Peters</a> for allowing us to use the Gospel presentation from his website.
